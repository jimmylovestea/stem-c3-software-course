The Palmer Penguins data contains size measurements for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The different species are

library(knitr)
include_graphics("lter_penguins.png")
```

These data were collected from 2007 - 2009 by Dr. Kristen Gorman with the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program, part of the US Long Term Ecological Research Network. The data were imported directly from the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) Data Portal, and are available for use by CC0 license (“No Rights Reserved”) in accordance with the Palmer Station Data Policy.

Variables that are included with the data set range from the `species` and `island` the birds were found on to attributes about the penguins themselves such as their bill length (mm), billdepth (mm), flipper length (mm), body mass (g), and sex. Many of these variables are fairly self-explanatory, but bill depth and bill length are illustrated below.
